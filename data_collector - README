In "data_collector.py" file a piece of code that is provided to collect real estate data from "www.sahibinden.com". The code iterates over
the house advertisements for a given city until desired number of data is collected. The code handles various for each attribute. For 
example number of floors in a building can be an integer or a string "30 ve Ã¼zeri" if there are 30 or more floors. But still some 
unexpected data may occur. In such cases code throws an exception message "Unexpected data occurred!". Also if the number of images in 
the advertisement is less than desired the code discards the current advertisement and its data and handles a new house advertisement.

Running code requires the city that you want to collect the data from, how many data will be collected, how many image data will be 
collected for each house and the folder path where the collected data will be saved in your computer. Attribute data is saved as a numpy
array in a ".npy" file and images are saved with ".jpg" extension. 
Requirements to run the code:

1- Selenium, requests, and numpy packages must be installed before.
2- Chrome Webdriver must be downloaded and added to to environment variables. You can see the page below for Chrome Webdriver;
  https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

Then you can run the code.
