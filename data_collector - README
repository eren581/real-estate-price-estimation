Running code requires the city that you want to collect the data from, how many data will be collected, how many image data will be 
collected for each house and the folder path where the collected data will be saved in your computer. Attribute data is saved as a numpy
array in a ".npy" file and images are saved with ".jpg" extension. Requirements to run the code:

1- Selenium, requests, and numpy packages must be installed before.
2- Chrome Webdriver must be downloaded and added to to environment variables.

Then you can run the code.
